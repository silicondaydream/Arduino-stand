## Design Files
- `arduino_stand.stl` - Design file to be sliced.
- `12hrarduino_stand.gcode` - Output file for my specific printer. DO NOT USE THIS.

## Tools Used
- OnShape: 3D design program
- Cura: Slicer program
- Ender 3 v2 PRO: Printer

## Viewing the Design
Download this repo and drag the stl file into your slicer of choice. Or redesign the stl file in your preferred CAD software.

### Software Recommendations
- OnShape: Free modeling software I use.
- Cura: My slicer of choice.

## Printing the Design
I use a humble Ender 3 v2 PRO to print 99% of my stuff. I utilize Inland PLA+ so I set the nozzle temp to 205C and the bed temp to 60C

### Printer Settings For This Design
- Resolution: Standard
- Infill: 20%
- Support: NO
- Layer Height: 0.2mm

### Material Recommendations
- PLA: Basic filament.
- PLA+: For stronger product needs.

## Usage
This project is intended for prototyping components
